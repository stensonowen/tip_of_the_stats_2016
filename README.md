#Tip of the Stats 2016

###*Unofficial* Statistics collected for Tip of the Hats 2016

I collected some data on this year's [Tip of the Hats](https://tipofthehats.org). Some stats from last year can be found [here](https://github.com/stensonowen/toth_stats) (and the reddit post [here](https://github.com/stensonowen/toth_stats)). 

I used a combination of things to collect data: 
    * a [large Rust project](https://github.com/stensonowen/page-mon/) I wrote over the summer to log Twitch viewers and [toth donations](https://tipofthehats.com/stats) to a git repo (config file [here](/code/config)), 
    * a gross [shell script](/code/log.sh) I threw together that does exactly the same thing as the Rust project just in case (and because I wasn't sure it would be ready on time) to monitor the same things, 
    * and [irssi](https://irssi.org/), a command-line IRC client, to record the Twitch chat.
